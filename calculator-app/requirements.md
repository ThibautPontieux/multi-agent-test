# Calculator App - Requirements & Design Specifications

## Project Overview
A clean, modern web-based calculator application for basic arithmetic operations.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality
- **US-001**: As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **US-002**: As a user, I want to see my input and results clearly on a display screen
- **US-003**: As a user, I want to clear the display or reset calculations
- **US-004**: As a user, I want to use both mouse clicks and keyboard input

### User Experience
- **US-005**: As a user, I want a responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- **US-006**: As a user, I want visual feedback when I interact with buttons
- **US-007**: As a user, I want error handling for invalid operations (divide by zero)

## Functional Requirements

### Calculator Features
- **F-001**: Display screen showing current input and result
- **F-002**: Number buttons (0-9) with clear, large touch targets
- **F-003**: Operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) with distinct styling
- **F-004**: Equals button (=) to execute calculations
- **F-005**: Clear button (C) to reset current calculation
- **F-006**: All Clear button (AC) to reset everything

### Technical Requirements
- **T-001**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript implementation
- **T-002**: Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- **T-003**: Clean, modern visual design with good contrast
- **T-004**: Keyboard support for all operations
- **T-005**: Error handling and input validation

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Design
- **Modern, clean interface** with plenty of whitespace
- **Large, easy-to-tap buttons** (minimum 44px touch target)
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with the display prominently featured
- **Professional color scheme** (consider dark/light theme support)

### Layout Structure
```
[    Display Screen    ]
[  AC  ] [  C  ] [ ÷  ]
[  7   ] [  8  ] [ 9  ] [ ×  ]
[  4   ] [  5  ] [ 6  ] [ -  ]
[  1   ] [  2  ] [ 3  ] [ +  ]
[    0      ] [ .  ] [ =  ]
```

### Interaction Design
- **Button press feedback** with hover/active states
- **Smooth transitions** for all interactions
- **Clear visual distinction** between numbers and operations
- **Input validation** with user-friendly error messages

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All arithmetic operations work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design tested on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] Keyboard input fully functional
